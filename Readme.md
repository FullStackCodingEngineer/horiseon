# Horiseon Web Site

This application provides information on a webpage for the company Horiseon, so they are then able to share the informarion that they want to their clients.

To install this, clone the code to your PC by using the "Git Clone" command in the terminal followed by the HTTP URL.

You are able to click the links to move to the different sections and read the different information in the seperate sections on the webpage. Have fun! :)

I worked on this project alone.
